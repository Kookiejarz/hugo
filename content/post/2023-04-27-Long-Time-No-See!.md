Hi, just share something exciting.
Just launched my own GPT website, for now on we can have access to chatgpt without vpn,
isn't that sounds good? And in fact, it was REALLY fast, and i think there's no speed limitation during my LocalGpt-test.(Not include the account was actually GPT-Plus)
Still worth to celebrate for!
Also, here's the link: chat.btlcraft.top:9011 (You may need an access token to use it)

Here is the instruction if you want to deploy personally: 
    - First, go to this repo: https://github.com/pengzhile/pandora (You can find the offical deploy instruction there)

    - Use pip(Or pip3) install "pandora-chatgpt" to download
     (Attention: your python version should not lower that 3.7. Run python -v to check your current version)

    - Use command <pandora> to start 

    ---------------------------
    - If you want to run as similar as ChatGPT:
    use: pip(Or pip3) install 'pandora-chatgpt[cloud]'
    Run <pandora-cloud> instead of <pandora>
